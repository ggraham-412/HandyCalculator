<h3>Handy Calculator</h3>
<p>
    Congratulations on your purchase of HandyCalculator,
    the only calculator available in the Play Store with
    fractional input and display, ideal for both carpenters
    and Eurodollar traders!
</p>

<p>
    Handy Caluclator is a basic infix calculator with a
    single memory and a retro visual style that is reminiscent
    of older digital calculators with bright plastic
    buttons and backlit LCD display.
</p>

<h4>Display</h4>

<p>
    In addition to the main numeric output, there are four indicators
    at the top of the display on the left and a remainder at the top
    on the right.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Mode</b> This can either be "ACC" when calculator
    results (ie- the contents of the accumulator) are being
    shown, or "ENT" when data is being entered.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Base</b> This can be "DEC" when the results will be
    displayed as a decimal number, or a fraction if the
    results should be displayed as a fraction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Memory</b> When a nonzero value is present in memory,
    this indicator will display an "M".
</p>

<p>
    <b>Pending Operation</b> When the user pushes one of
    the four available operations (+, -, X, &#00F7; ) it
    will be displayed as a pending op until the user
    enters the second operand.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remainder</b>  When displaying in a fractional base,
    if the exact numeric result does not fit exactly on a
    fraction boundary, the difference is shown above the
    main result as a remainder.  The displayed number plus the
    remainder is equal to the exact value.
</p>

<h4>Basic Operations</h4>

<p>
    <b>Clear (C)</b> The clear button will set both the
    current entry and the accumulated result to zero, and
    will nullify any pending operation.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Clear Entry (CE)</b> The clear entry button will
    set only the current entry to zero, but will leave
    the accumulated result and pending operation alone.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Memory (MR) and (MS)</b>  The mem store (MS)
    button will store the current accumulated result
    in memory if it is currently being displayed
