<h3>Handy Calculator</h3>
<p>
    Congratulations on your purchase of HandyCalculator,
    the only calculator available in the Play Store with
    fractional input and display, ideal for both carpenters
    and Eurodollar futures traders!
</p>

<p>
    Handy Caluclator is a basic infix calculator with a
    single memory and a retro visual style that is reminiscent
    of older digital calculators with bright plastic bakelite
    buttons and backlit LCD display.
</p>

<h4>Quick Start</h4>

<p>
    This calculator is mostly just like any common electronic
    calculator with infix input.  The main difference is that in
    addition to the decimal point (.) key, there are fraction keys
    that allow you to quickly and naturally enter numbers in
    fractional notation.
</p>

<p>
    For example, to compute 6.7 plus 12.3, you would normally
    push keys in the sequence (6) (.) (7) (+) (1) (2) (.) (3) (=).
</p>

<p>
    But say you wanted to compute 6 7/32 plus 12 3/4, you would instead
    push keys in the sequence (6) (1/32) (7) (+) (1) (2) (1/4) (3) (=).
</p>

<p>
    Say you wanted to compute the diagonal of a rectangle with sides
    6 7/32" and 12 3/4", you would use the convenient quadrature
    addition operation:
    push keys in the sequence (6) (1/32) (7) (Q+) (1) (2) (1/4) (3) (=).
</p>

<p>
    Say you knew the diagonal and one side, and wanted to compute the
    missing side of a rectangle.  You would use the convenient quadrature
    subtraction operation:
    push keys in the sequence (14) (1/32) (6) (Q-) (1) (2) (1/4) (3) (=).
</p>

<p>
    The results are still displayed as decimals.  But that can be changed
    too by selecting a fraction for display, by pushing the (DISP) button
    followed by one of the fraction choices.  When displaying fractions,
    if a number does not fit exactly on a fraction boundary, a remainder
    is displayed in the upper left corner.
</p>

<p>
    That's probably going to cover 90% of the new functionality.  For more
    information, please refer to one of the following reference guides.
</p>

<h4>Display Reference Guide</h4>

<p>
    In addition to the main numeric output, there are four indicators
    at the top of the display on the left and a remainder at the top
    on the right.
</p>

    <img src="img/HandyCalculator_display.png"/>

<p>
    <b>Mode</b> This can either be "ACC" when calculator
    results (ie- the contents of the accumulator) are being
    shown, or "ENT" when data is being entered.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Base</b> This can be "DEC" when the results will be
    displayed as a decimal number, or a fraction if the
    results should be displayed as a fraction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Memory</b> When a nonzero value is present in memory,
    this indicator will display an "M".
</p>

<p>
    <b>Pending Operation</b> When the user pushes one of
    the four available operations (+, -, X, &#0247; ) it
    will be displayed as a pending op until the user
    enters the second operand.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remainder</b>  When displaying in a fractional base,
    if the exact numeric result does not fit exactly on a
    fraction boundary, the difference is shown above the
    main result as a remainder.  The displayed number plus the
    remainder is equal to the exact value.
</p>

<h4>Operations Reference Guide</h4>

<p>
    <b>Clear (C)</b> The clear button will set both the
    current entry and the accumulated result to zero, and
    will nullify any pending operation.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Clear Entry (CE)</b> The clear entry button will
    set only the current entry to zero, but will leave
    the accumulated result and pending operation alone.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Memory (MR) and (MS)</b>  The mem store (MS)
    button will store the current accumulated result
    or the current numeric entry in memory depending on
    what is currently showing in the display.  The
    mem recall button will copy the current value from
    memory into the current numeric entry as if the
    user just entered it.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Square Button (X^2)</b> The square button will
    set the current entry or the current accumulated
    result to its square and leave pending operations
    alone.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Square Root Button (&#8730;)</b> The square root
    button will set the current entry or the current
    accumulated result to its square root and leave
    pending operations alone.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Quadrature Add (Q+)</b> The quadrature add
    will cause the display to show the current accumulated
    result (ACC) and will store the selected operation as a
    pending operation, awaiting the entry of a second operand.
    The operation is addition in quadrature: sqrt(op1**2 + op2**2)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Quadrature Sub (Q-)</b> The quadrature subtract
    will cause the display to show the current accumulated
    result (ACC) and will store the selected operation as a
    pending operation, awaiting the entry of a second operand.
    The operation is subtraction in quadrature: sqrt(op1**2 - op2**2)
    (If the result is taking the sqrt of a negative number,
    NaN will be displayed.)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Number Keys</b>  The number keys (0-9) will add a digit
    to the current numeric entry.  If the calculator is
    currently displaying a result (ACC), the number key will
    first transition to data entry mode (ENT).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Operation keys</b> The operation keys (+, -, X, &#0247;)
    will cause the display to show the current accumulated
    result (ACC) and will store the selected operation as a
    pending operation, awaiting the entry of a second operand.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Equals</b> The Equals (=) key will cause the current
    pending operation to be evaluated using the current
    numeric entry as the second operand.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Change Sign</b> The change sign (+/-) key will cause the
    current value of the accumulator or the numeric entry to be
    replaced with its negative, depending on which value
    is currently being shown.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Decimal/Fraction Keys</b>
    The decimal and fraction keys are special in that they affect
    numeric input.  For a number in decimal notation, the decimal
    point signals that entry to the left of the decimal point is
    finished, and further digits are to be appended to the right
    of the decimal point.  For a number in fractional notation,
    the sequence is similar.  A fraction button also signals that
    entry to the left of the decimal point is finished, but further
    digits are added to the numerator of a fraction with the
    selected base.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Display Key</b> The display key (DISP) is used to select the
    fractional base to be used when displaying the current accumulated
    result.  When the (DISP) key is pushed, the user must enter a
    fraction/decimal choice for the display, or must push (DISP)
    again to cancel.  When a new display fraction is selected,
    the choice will be displayed in the associated indicator.  If
    the current accumulated numeric value doesn't fit exactly in the
    selected fraction base, then a remainder will be displayed.
    (See above.)
</p>

<h4>Options</h4>

<p>
    <b>Allow Improper Fractions</b>  If selected, the user can input up to three
    digits of numerator in fractional input even if the fraction is improper.
    The entered fraction is rendered proper as soon as input is finished.
    Otherwise, the user cannot enter improper fractions.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remainder Display Mode</b>  The remainder can be displayed as an exact decimal,
    or it can be displayed in the same fractional base currently used for the display,
    or it can be turned off completely.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Debug Mode</b>  When selected, the actual values of numeric entry and
    the acculumator are displayed beneath the calculator.
